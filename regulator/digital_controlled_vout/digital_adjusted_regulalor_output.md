# Digital adjusted regulator output

## Keywords
Voltage regulator, supply, PWM/DAC controlled output, calculation formula

## Abstract
In some cases is a digital controllable output voltages of a V<sub>FB</sub> or V<sub>REF</sub> input regulator desirable. The calculation and dimensioning of the feedback network is described in this article.
