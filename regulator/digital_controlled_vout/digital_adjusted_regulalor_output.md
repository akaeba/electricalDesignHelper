# Digital adjusted regulator output

## Keywords
Voltage regulator, supply, PWM/DAC controlled output, calculation formula

## Abstract
In some cases are digital controllable output voltages of a V<sub>REF</sub> regulator desirable. The calculation and dimensioning of the feedback network is described in this article.
